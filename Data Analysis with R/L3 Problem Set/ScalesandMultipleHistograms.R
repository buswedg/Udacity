# ===============================================================

# In the last exercise, we looked at the summary statistics
# for diamond price by cut. If we look at the output table, the
# the median and quartiles are reasonably close to each other.

#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     337    2050    3282    4359    5206   18570

# This means the distributions should be somewhat similar,
# but the histograms we created don't show that.

# The 'Fair' and 'Good' diamonds appear to have 
# different distributions compared to the better
# cut diamonds. They seem somewhat uniform
# on the left with long tails on the right.

# Let's look in to this more.

# Look up the documentation for facet_wrap in R Studio.
# Then, scroll back up and add a parameter to facet_wrap so that
# the y-axis in the histograms is not fixed. You want the y-axis to
# be different for each histogram.
